# ðŸŽ¬ Frontend Integration Guide

Your React frontend is now integrated with the ML-powered movie recommendation backend! Now with enhanced movie metadata including year, genre, and detailed descriptions.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python start_backend.py
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd project
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open the App
Visit `http://localhost:5173` to see your ML-powered movie recommendation app!

## ðŸ”§ What's New

### ML-Powered Recommendations
- **AI Backend**: Connected to FastAPI with Random Forest Classifier
- **Real-time Predictions**: Get movie recommendations based on mood, weather, and day
- **Confidence Scores**: Each recommendation shows AI confidence level
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Real movie year, genre, and detailed descriptions
- **Fallback Mode**: Works even if backend is unavailable

### Enhanced UI Features
- **Connection Status**: Shows if ML backend is connected
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when API is unavailable
- **Loading States**: Better user experience during API calls
- **Confidence Visualization**: Progress bars showing AI confidence
- **Enhanced Movie Cards**: Display real year, genre, and descriptions

## ðŸ“¡ API Integration

### Backend Connection
The frontend automatically connects to `http://localhost:8000` by default.

### Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the `project` directory:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /options` - Available moods, weather, days
- `POST /recommend` - Single movie recommendation with metadata
- `POST /recommendations` - Multiple movie recommendations with metadata

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### 1. User Selection
- User selects their mood (Happy, Relaxed, Melancholic, etc.)
- User selects weather (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Snowy)
- Day is auto-detected (Weekday/Weekend)

### 2. ML Processing
- Frontend sends request to ML backend
- Random Forest model processes the inputs
- Returns movie recommendations with confidence scores and enhanced metadata

### 3. Results Display
- Shows recommended movies with confidence percentages
- Displays enhanced movie information (year, genre, description)
- Ranks recommendations by AI confidence
- Beautiful movie cards with detailed metadata

## ðŸ”„ Fallback Mode

If the ML backend is unavailable:
- Shows warning message
- Uses pre-defined fallback recommendations
- App continues to work normally
- User can still get movie suggestions

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Components

### Enhanced Components
- **MoodSelector**: Now uses ML backend mood options
- **WeatherSelector**: Updated for ML weather types
- **DaySelector**: Enhanced layout and ML day types
- **MovieCard**: Shows AI confidence, ranking, year, genre, and description
- **App**: Connection status and error handling

### New Features
- **Connection Indicator**: Green for connected, yellow for fallback
- **Confidence Bars**: Visual representation of AI confidence
- **Ranking Badges**: Shows recommendation rank (#1, #2, etc.)
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Real movie year, genre, and descriptions
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback when things go wrong

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test the Integration
1. Start both backend and frontend
2. Select different moods, weather, and days
3. Check that recommendations change appropriately
4. Verify confidence scores are displayed
5. Verify movie metadata (year, genre, description) is shown correctly
6. Test fallback mode by stopping the backend

### API Testing
```bash
# Test backend directly
cd backend
python test_api.py
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

### Frontend Deployment
- Build: `npm run build`
- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting
- Update `VITE_API_URL` for production backend

### Backend Deployment
- Deploy to Heroku, Railway, or cloud platform
- Update frontend environment variable
- Ensure CORS is configured for your domain

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Backend not connecting**: Check if `python start_backend.py` is running
2. **CORS errors**: Backend has CORS enabled for localhost
3. **Port conflicts**: Change backend port in `app.py` if needed
4. **Model not found**: Run `python train_model.py` first
5. **Metadata not showing**: Ensure backend is returning enhanced metadata

### Debug Mode
- Check browser console for API errors
- Backend logs show request details
- Frontend shows connection status

## ðŸ“Š Performance

### Frontend
- Fast loading with Vite
- Optimized bundle size
- Smooth animations and transitions

### Backend
- FastAPI for high performance
- ML model loads once on startup
- Response times < 100ms
- Enhanced metadata support

## ðŸŽ‰ What's Next

### Potential Enhancements
1. **User Accounts**: Save favorite movies and preferences
2. **More Movies**: Expand the dataset with more Bollywood films
3. **Advanced ML**: Try different algorithms (Neural Networks, etc.)
4. **Mobile App**: React Native version
5. **Social Features**: Share recommendations with friends
6. **Movie Posters**: Integrate movie poster APIs
7. **User Ratings**: Collect and use user feedback

### Technical Improvements
1. **Caching**: Cache recommendations for better performance
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket for live recommendations
3. **A/B Testing**: Test different ML models
4. **Analytics**: Track user preferences and model performance
5. **Database**: Store movie metadata in database
6. **Image Processing**: Extract movie posters automatically
